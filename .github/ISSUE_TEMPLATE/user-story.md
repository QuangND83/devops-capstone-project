**As a** user
**I need** to be able to search for products by name
**So that** I can quickly find the products I'm looking for

### Details and Assumptions
* The search functionality should be case-insensitive.
* The search results should be sorted by relevance.

### Acceptance Criteria
**Given** I am on the product search page
**When** I enter a product name into the search bar and click search
**Then** the search results page should display products that match the search term.
